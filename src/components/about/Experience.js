          Sixheads - Developer &amp; Partner
        </h3>
        <p>
          While at Shillington I continued to freelance as a designer/developer.
          This then turned into Sixheads, a design and development studio I run
          with my partner Bec. My primary role here is as a frontend developer.
          But being a small business it also means wearing many hats, be that
          managing clients, doing accounts, generating estimates and developing
          new business.

        <h3 className="experience__title">Shillington - Director of Digital</h3>
        <p>
          As Director of Digital I was responsible for lifting the overall level
          of digital content in the course globally. Content and student briefs
          developed during this time aimed to be as 'real world' as I could make
          them. I also introduced more UX thinking and processes into the
          curriculum to compliment the digital design components. In 2016 I
          moved the course away from Photoshop for digital design and replaced
          it with Sketch which made a marked difference to the students work and
          productivity.

        <h3 className="experience__title">Shillington - Web Course Director</h3>
        <p>
          In 2012 I was tasked with developing a new web course for the college
          aimed at teaching graphic designers the basics of HTML and CSS.
          Distilling so much technical content into a 1 week course, while also
          making it appealing and relevant to our audience has got to be one of
          the most challenging things I have ever done. Teaching it was great
          fun, especially taking it to London and New York.

        <p>
          My next exciting challenge was launching a new Shillington campus in
          Manchester UK. Taking all that I'd learnt from Brisbane and Melbourne
          I gathered an excellent team of talented designers to work with me. We
          then slowly built up the profile of the college in Manchester and
          establish ourselves in the local design scene. Added to that the GFC
          hit just when we opened our doors, but despite that we managed to grow
          and thrive.

        <p>
          Moving back to Melbourne I was tasked with re-staffing a number of
          newly vacated roles in both FT and PT. I managed to find two brilliant
          new FT teachers and train them up to take over running the campus in
          the space of 9 short months.

          Shillington - Director Brisbane &amp; Course Director
        </h3>
        <p>
          Having impressed in my previous roles I was asked to open a new campus
          in Brisbane. Here I honed new skills in hiring staff and and then
          training them to be effective design teachers. I also had the
          challenge of managing a campus and promoting this new endeavour in
          Brisbane. I also moved into a more senior role as Course Director
          overseeing course curriculum for both FT and PT.

        <h3 className="experience__title">Shillington - Head of Part-time</h3>
        <p>
          While continuing to teacher PT I also took on the role of Head of
          Part-time. This role involved adapting certain parts of the course
          curriculum to better suit the time constraints and student
          requirements particular to the PT course. I also advised PT teachers
          from the other campuses and provided training to new teachers.

        <h3 className="experience__title">Shillington - Part-time Teacher</h3>
        <p>
          Part-time students come to a course with much more varied long term
          goals so part of my role was adapting my teaching style and content
          delivery. My aim here was to ensure each student came away with the
          skills they needed whether they were planning a career change into
          Graphic Design or simply upskilling within their current role.

        <h3 className="experience__title">Shillington - Teacher</h3>
        <p>
          In both Sydney and Melbourne I taught students in the full-time
          Graphic Design course. I was responsible for giving lectures, running
          workshops, critiquing student work and offering technical instruction.
          Here I also learnt my love of the mic and a captive audience!
